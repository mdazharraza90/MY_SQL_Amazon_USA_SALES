# MY_SQL_Amazon_USA_SALES
Amazon USA Sales Analysis

* I worked on a project where I analyzed over 20,000 sales records from an e-commerce platform similar to Amazon. I used MySQL to study customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends.

* As part of the project, I wrote different SQL queries to answer business questions like tracking revenue, segmenting customers, and managing inventory. I also cleaned the data and handled missing values to make sure the analysis was accurate.

# Dataset Overview:

* The project uses 9 tables: Customers, Products, Categories, Sellers, Orders, Order Items, Shipping, Payments, and Inventory.

* Relationships were established through primary and foreign keys to ensure data integrity and enable complex queries.

* To make the database structure easy to understand, I included an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) that shows how the tables are related.
